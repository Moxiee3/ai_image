# ai_image

On day 23 of this challenge, we will build an AI Image Generator App UI using Flutter. This app allows users to generate images based on given text or prompts with the help of AI technology (like OpenAI's DALL-E or similar APIs). The focus is on creating a modern, intuitive, and engaging interface for users.
